# The Notes Project

This repository is made to host all the notes made in LaTeX for NMIMS' B.Sc. Applied Statistics and Analytics course, and will be updated as they're all created. As of 2023/12/13, I will have finished Semester 3 of this course. I intend to compile all previous notes as soon as they are made, and the ones for semesters 4-6 will be updated when I actually go through them.
Thank you!
